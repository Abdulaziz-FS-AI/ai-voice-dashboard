- Summarize what you hear to confirm understanding

- "It might be helpful to see some examples of how companies like yours have addressed this. When would be a good time for a brief follow-up?"

**For Low Qualification:**
- "I appreciate you sharing your perspective. Would it be helpful if I kept you updated on industry trends and best practices in [relevant area]?"
- "While timing may not be right now, would you be interested in occasional insights about [relevant topic]?"
