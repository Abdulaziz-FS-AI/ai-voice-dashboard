## Important Notes for Claude
1. **User has been working with another developer** - Always check current state before making changes
2. **Test mode is critical** - PIN 123456 enables full demo functionality
3. **Theme system is complete** - Don't modify unless specifically requested
4. **Build must always pass** - Run `npm run build` before any major changes
5. **Admin access patterns** - Check `adminConfig.ts` and test mode logic

## Key Code Patterns
### Admin Access Check
```typescript
const isUserAdmin = propIsAdmin || isAuthorizedAdmin(user, userName);
// In test mode: setIsAdminUnlocked(true); grants admin access
```

### Theme Usage
```typescript
const { isDark, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
// Apply classes: theme-bg-primary, theme-text-primary, theme-button
```

### VAPI Integration
```typescript
const client = createVapiClient({ apiKey });
const assistants = await client.getAssistants();
```

## Emergency Recovery Commands
```bash
# Build check
npm run build

# Start development
npm start

# Check git status
git status

# Reset if needed
git stash
git pull origin main
```

## Context Management Strategy
- **Status File**: This file serves as complete project memory
- **Recovery Command**: "Read CLAUDE_PROJECT_STATUS.md and continue from where we left off"
