- This is normal DynamoDB behavior and doesn't affect production use
- Users can register → wait briefly → login successfully

### **VAPI Key Strategy**

- Demo mode available for users without VAPI access

### **TypeScript Warnings**
- Some React Router type warnings during deployment (non-blocking)
- Backend compiles and deploys successfully despite warnings
- All functionality works perfectly
